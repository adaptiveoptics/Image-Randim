Image::Randim::Source provides a quick way to pull information about
random image from an online image provider, such as Desktoppr or
Unsplash.

It was created to make it easy to look at many different random images
for desktop wallpaper switching.

The library provides a means to pull just the necessary information to
get the image URLs, but does not provide the download capability.

The included script "randim" does provide that ability, though, along
with ways to store images you like locally and change the desktop
background.

The module can easily be expanded to support additional online sources
by creating a module that implements Image::Randim::Source::Role and
I'd love to add some more.

POD documentation is included with each module and the script.
