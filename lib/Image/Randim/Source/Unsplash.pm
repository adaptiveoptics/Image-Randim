=head1 NAME

Image::Randim::Source::Unsplash - Unsplash source plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Image::Randim::Source;
  
  $source = Image::Randim::Source->new;
  $source->set_provider('Unsplash');
  $image = $source->get_image;

  say $image->url;

  # OR if you want to use your own Unsplash API client key
  # access the src_obj and set it there before calling get_image

  $source->src_obj->api_key('980ef8da882...');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You will probably not want to call this directly, and instead ose
Image::Randim::Source as described in that class' documentation.

Unsplash requires that you use a so-called developer API client key to
get a random image information. However, these client keys can be
rate-limited.

If you experience this, you can register for your own developer client
API key and use it instead as outlined in the SYNOPSIS.

Otherwise, this "plugin" conforms to the Image::Randim::Source::Role
just like the others.
